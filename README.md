# Blood Blockchain

People donate blood 
They can see how many people their blood helps or if it gets sold to cover operating costs
They get tokens / reputation for doing so
They can redeem these tokens and % will get donated to charity
Can get businesses like BCG to partner and they can match donations

when hospitals are short on blood, we can have a 2x event where blood donations at this time period get double the points

helps charities and helps patients get more blood
this app helps people as we try to reduce shortage of blood
