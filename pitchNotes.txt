 - PROBLEM - people are dying on waiting list
 

 -- over one hundred thousand waiting
 -- 38 die 
 -- every 10 minutes someone gets added

 -- heart only last 4 hours
 - you have to time it correctly, transport, everything
 - this is a time crtical thing 
 - and what if downtime?? downtime = death

 - downtime = death
 - also consider transportation, making decentralized
 - 38 die

 -- currently a non profit is handling this all on a centralized network
 -- time to leverage the latest tech - blockchain
end 60 seconds
rush through ADDRESS Problem so we don't waste time here

2 minute: demo
- now take your time talking
- done with presentation


- front end portal
- login 
- we can access the blockchain euth ipfs
- right now, we implemented where they see organ and expiration
- later, auto route alogirthm coud be a possibily

Donor chain

Donor market

the list is known of who is next in line
They can see if the kidney (From a organ donor) will actually go to next in line, and not to the black market
Get tokens to help bury the donor

Maybe also see the organ of their family into who has it now

but only if they sign the disclosure,
Otherwise right now it’s de identified



Hiv contamination and tracking that


# Pitch Notes

## Problem

Story: When you donate blood, it either goes to be sold to a hospital or sold to cover operating costs.

## Solution
We made a ‘feel good’ app that checks accountability and lets you know where your blood goes… whether it helps a person or to cover operating costs.
We also reward people that donate blood, tokens called ate
That takes a cut of of the money and the donator can decide what charity they will have to donate to
2 good deeds in 1! Donating blood and to charity of your choice

## Demo time!


## Team, viability, road map, other stuff to share

* Companies often match donations and they can have match these tokens
* Some times hospital runs low, we can have 2x token events during this time frame
* As well as the reputation part of this, the donor can see their track record of donations, charities donated to and how many times they donated blood
* This can help the healthcare system overall by promoting people do keep helping the help system
* Someone that donates blood a lot, the hospital could potentially see this (but hippa and phi) and they could be bumped up in queue to get blood when needed since they are active participant in helping healthcare by giving blood frequency
* Insurance companies can see this and since people that generally give blood are healthier
